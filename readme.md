# terminal-node-scripting

This project is mainly an experiment with React Ink.
In this project, I'm attempting to create a terminal visual scripting library.
Currently, I'm trying to have working nodes and edges.

I used React Ink to create a custom rendering that computes the correct character for each "pixel" of the editor.

The user can move freely in the editor using the arrow keys.
